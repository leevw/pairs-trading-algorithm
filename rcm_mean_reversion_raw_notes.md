[Basics of Mean Reversion Trading | Stock Trading Strategies | By Dr. Ernest Chan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G7YdjnRvVI)

- Long short portfolio
  - ranking based on 'factors'
- Factor models
  - factor is like another word for criteria
  - signals depend on expected return from a linear combination of fundamental or statistical factors
  - can be any type of factor
  - can even be complicated factors from PCA
  - fundamental factors from financial statements
- Types of Mean Reversion strategies
  - Pairs Trading
  - Portfolio Trading
  - Index Arbitrage
  - Long-Short Portfolio Models
- Stationarity
  - forms the basis of mean reverting strategy
  - it means that a time series do not wander off into infinity as time goes on
  - random walk is not staionarity
  - if a asset price is stationary, we can use a simple mean-reverting strategy in which we buy low and sell high
- How to test for Stationarity: ADF Test
  - the change of the price series in the next period of tiem, is proportional to difference between the mean price and the current price
  - if the price is below the mean in the current period, it is assumed to go up. If it is above the mean, it is assumed the price will go down
  - it will revert back to the mean only if there is a proportionality constant that is not zero, and is negative
  - ADF tests if the regression coefficient between the next period price change and the current difference between the mean and the price.
  - ADF tests whether we can reject the null hypothesis that the proportionality constant is zero
  - it is a statistical signifigance test of the regression coefficient to seeo if it is zero or not
  - if you run the test on most time series, you will seldomly be able to reject the null hypothesis, as most are not stationary
- Cointegration
  - We can construct a portfolio and price series where it is stationary.
  - you just need to find two instruments (aka stocks)
  - you will find one that you go long on, and one that you go short on
  - if you test this portfolio of two instruments you can sometimes find that they are stationary
  - the price of the portfolio represents the net market value of the portfolio
  - we can apply the ADF test to see if the portfolio is stationary
  - if it is stationary we can say that the stocks are cointegrated
  - example of a cointegrated portfolio:
    - Long 1 share of GLD
    - Short 1.63 shares of GDX
- Cointegration:
  - stationary portfolio, all the stocks together create a stationary portfolio
  - we buy when MV is low, Sell when MV is high
  - trade it like an ETF
- Cointegration is NOT Correlation:
  - with correlation we are concerned with whether daily returns of 2 stocks are in the same (or maybe even opposite) direction
  - with cointegration we are concerned with whether 2 price series diverge (pull apart) over a long term.
  - Coke and Pepsi are highly correlated but they do not cointegrate
    - over a long period their spread (net market value of portfolio, of long coke short pepsi or vice versa) is not mean reverting at all
    - their spread is not stationary
- Cointegration is Long Term and Prices
- Correlation is Short Term and Returns
- Types of Mean Reversion Strategies:
  - Bollinger Bands
    - using moving average to determine the mean
    - Enter into a position only when price deviates by more than a standard deviation
    - Exit when price mean reverts
    - it has one single sliding window that compute mean and standard deviation
    - this mean changes since it is a sliding window of moving average
    - There is NO guarantee that the exit will be profitable, due to this sliding window
- Transactional costs is usually one downside to mean reversion
- in theory larger portfolios are less susceptible to random events, but incur larger transaction costs in practice

- can (hopefully) deliver consistent returns
- but it can be tempting to overleverage them
- highly vulnerable to Black Swan events
- do not over leverage
- put in stop losses only for catastrophic losses
  - stop losses almost always decrease backtest performance
  - we put these in place for Black Swans that we have not seen in backtest
- beware of survivorship bias in backtesting
- buying put options is not ideal
- DL and DRL, have not proved well due to more parameters than available features. Models have overfit
- prefers classification over regression, for predictions
  - has seen regression model get both the estimate and sign (negative or positve) incorrect
- stop loss only for catastrophy insurance
  - want it at a pain point of like 20% of total assets
  - prefer this strategy over something like 3 standard deviations
- they use ML models, with over 170 params, and non-linear strategies

[Integration, Cointegration, and Stationarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn_RiDbK82M)

- Wide sense stationarity
  - mean and standard deviations are constant, throughout an entire length of a time series
  - stationary time series is all drawn from the same probability distribution, all with the same parameters. For Instance, lets say it is a normal distribution, it will have the same mean and variance no matter where it is.
  - this is important because it is the underlying assumption that the statistical tests we will run are based on.
  - For Instance, AutoRegression and Moving Average Models
  - All the techniques assume stationarity
  - we are fitting to a probability distribution, some underlying characteristics of the data. We want our assumptions to continue to hold into the future.
  - if there is a shift, then our models get thrown off. We would be basing the model on a different assumption than the current reality.
- Why Non-Stationarity is dangerous
  - most statistical tests require data to be stationary
