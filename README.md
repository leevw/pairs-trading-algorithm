This repository contains the files and programs necessary to implement a pair trading algorithm in the stock market.

## What Is Pair Trading?
Pair trading is a strategy of investing that seeks to capitalize on price discrepancies between two related stocks. This strategy enables traders to identify and exploit specialized conditions in the market as an arbitrage opportunity. By taking a long position in the undervalued stock and a short position in the overvalued stock, traders can reduce their risk and lock in potential profits.

## Files & Programs
This repository contains the following files and programs: 

- `PairTradingAlgorithm.py` â€“ This program contains the algorithm code for implementing the pair trading strategy. 
- `Datasets` - This folder contains the datasets used in this project. 
- `Results` - This folder contains the results of the backtesting of the pair trading algorithm. 
- `Slides` - This folder contains the slides used in the presentation of this project. 

## Requirements
In order to use the pair trading algorithm program, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries installed: 

- Numpy
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
To implement the pair trading algorithm, simply use the `PairTradingAlgorithm.py` program. You can customize the algorithm by adjusting the parameters in the corresponding code.
